BittBridge GitHub Practice Script: Let's Play with Numbers!

This simple script is designed to help our team practice creating and resolving GitHub issues,
as well as branching and submitting pull requests, by collaboratively fixing small mistakes 
and completing missing pieces in the code.

"""

# 1. Welcome message
print("Welcome to our Bridge playground!")

# 2. Let's define some numbers
x = 12
y = 4

# 3. Print sum and product
print("Sum:", x + y)
print("Product:", x * y)

# 4. Print the difference between x and y
print("Difference:", abs(x - y))

# 5. Print the result of x divided by y
# print("Division:", )

# 6. Let's define a list of numbers
numbers = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]

# 7. Print how many numbers are in the list
print("There are", len(numbers), "numbers in the list.")

# 8. Print the first and last number
print("First:", numbers[1])
print("Last:", numbers[-1])

# 9. Remove the number 12 from the list
# numbers.remove(12)

# 10. Add a new number (27) to the list
# numbers.append()

# 11. Sort the list and print it
# print("Sorted list:", )

# 12. Print all numbers greater than 10
print("Numbers greater than 10:")
for num in numbers:
    if num > 10:
        print(num)

# 13. Add a summary line that says "This script ran successfully!"
